## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-15

First public release on PyPI. The `cataforge` CLI can bootstrap a project
scaffold and deploy it to four AI IDE platforms from a single
`.cataforge/` spec.

### Added

- **Unified CLI** (`cataforge`) with subcommands: `setup`, `deploy`,
  `doctor`, `hook`, `agent`, `skill`, `mcp`, `plugin`, `docs`, `penpot`,
  `upgrade`.
- **Multi-platform deploy** — bundled adapters for Claude Code, Cursor,
  Codex, and OpenCode, discovered via the `cataforge.platforms`
  entry-point group.
- **Bundled scaffold** — `cataforge setup` copies a full `.cataforge/`
  skeleton (agents, skills, rules, hooks, platform profiles, schemas)
  into a fresh project; no `git clone` required.
- **Skill runtime** — declarative SKILL.md discovery plus a
  `SkillRunner` that invokes built-in and project-level scripts with a
  consistent `CATAFORGE_PROJECT_ROOT` environment.
- **MCP registry & lifecycle** — declarative `.cataforge/mcp/*.yaml`
  specs, `cataforge.mcp` entry-points, and process start/stop with
  on-disk state under `.cataforge/.mcp-state/`.
- **Plugin loader** — `cataforge.plugins` entry-points and project-local
  `.cataforge/plugins/*/cataforge-plugin.yaml` manifests.
- **Hook bridge** — JSON-stdin dispatch to framework-level hook scripts
  with configurable skip rules.
- **Platform conformance tests** — every adapter is exercised against a
  shared capability checklist.
- **UTF-8 stdio guard** — CLI reconfigures stdout/stderr on Windows
  `cp936` terminals so status glyphs render without `PYTHONUTF8=1`.
- **MIT license**, PyPI classifiers, `py.typed` marker for downstream
  type-checkers.

### Roadmap (stub in 0.1.0)

The following subcommands exit with code 2 and print an actionable
hint; full implementation is tracked for later milestones:

- `cataforge upgrade {check,apply,verify}` — planned v0.2.
- `cataforge hook test <name>` — planned v0.2.
- `cataforge plugin {install,remove}` — planned v0.3.
